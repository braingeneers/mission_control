## File Operations

- Use `trash` instead of `rm`.

## Service Operations

- Do not create, update, patch, replace, or delete Kubernetes Secrets. Secret mutations are operator-owned; provide the required instructions and wait for the operator to apply them.
- Do not run production-style `mission_control` services locally unless the user explicitly asks for a local test.
- Services such as `mqtt-job-listener`, `maxwell-dashboard`, and other Docker Compose managed lab services are intended to run on `braingeneers.gi.ucsc.edu`.
- When service restart, pull, recreate, or deployment operations are needed, instruct the user to handle them on the `braingeneers` server instead of running them from a local workstation.
- Keep uploader `proxy_set_header` directives at vhost scope. Defining any in a
  generated `_location` prevents inheritance of the trusted identity-header
  overrides and downstream `Authorization` stripping from `service-proxy/default`.
- Keep `proxy_pass_request_body off` and an empty `Content-Length` header inside
  the `/_oauth2_proxy_auth` location in `service-proxy/default`. Authentication
  subrequests do not receive the original request body; forwarding its length
  makes authenticated POST, PUT, and PATCH requests wait indefinitely.
- Run `make test` after changing Compose or proxy configuration. It validates Compose, authenticated
  uploader proxy inheritance, production/acceptance uploader bucket and image contracts, and the
  stale-container deployment verifier.
- Leave `uploader` without `container_name` so Compose manages production naming. Set
  `uploader-dev` to `container_name: uploader-dev` so its operator log prefix matches the service
  name; keep contract tests for both choices.
- Keep both uploader services at `PROD=true`. Despite its acceptance hostname, `uploader-dev`
  discovers, updates, and uploads datasets in the production `braingeneers` bucket.
- After an operator updates either uploader service, run
  `make verify-uploader-deployment SERVICE=uploader` or
  `make verify-uploader-deployment SERVICE=uploader-dev` on the server. A pull plus restart does not
  replace an existing container; the verifier compares the configured and running image IDs.
