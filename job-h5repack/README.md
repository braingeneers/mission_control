## Job-h5-repack Documentation

The job-h5-repack is a process that optimizes the structure of HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format) files. This optimization is crucial for enhancing the speed at which data can be read by `braingeneerspy`, a Python package that we maintain, as it allows parallelized reading across each channel in the HDF5 files. This process is automatically initiated whenever a new dataset is uploaded and a corresponding message is posted to the MQTT topic `experiments/upload`. 

### Automatic Deployment and Parallelization 

The job-h5-repack is the first process to be run in our data processing workflow, prior to spike sorting. It is parallelized across files to enhance speed and efficiency. The job-h5-repack process is automatically deployed by the job-launcher service, eliminating the need for manual triggering of the process.

### Components of the Job-h5-repack Process

**1. UUID (Universal Unique Identifier):**
The UUID is the unique name of the dataset stored in the S3 bucket `s3://braingeneers/ephys/UUID`. It is formed as `DATE-e-NAME`, with `DATE` and `NAME` being variable components.

**2. h5repack:**
h5repack is a utility provided by the HDF Group that is used to repack HDF5 files, changing their byte packing order to make the data reading order more efficient.

**3. MessageBroker:**
MessageBroker is an internal wrapper used for communication between MQTT, Redis, and other inter-device communication services. It plays a critical role in the job-h5-repack process by managing the job queue.

**4. Dockerfile:**
The Dockerfile contains the instructions for Docker to build an image to run the job-h5-repack process. This Docker image is built from the `braingeneers/braingeneers:latest` image, which includes the job-h5-repack files and defines the working directory as `/job_h5repack`. 

**5. Kubernetes (K8s) Job Files:**
These YAML configuration files (`init-job.yaml`, `workers-job.yaml`) define and configure the Kubernetes jobs for the job-h5-repack process. 

**6. Scripts and Python Files:**
These files contain the code that drives the job-h5-repack process. `h5repack_task.sh` handles the downloading, repacking, and uploading of files. `init.py` initializes the process, while `update_metadata.py` updates the metadata after processing each file.

### Operational Flow of the Job-h5-repack Process

**Step 1: Initialization (`init.py`)**
The process begins by loading the metadata of the uploaded dataset and populating the job queue with the files to be processed.

**Step 2: Download, Repack, and Upload (`h5repack_task.sh`)**
In this step, worker jobs consume the tasks from the job queue. For each file in the queue:

* The presence of the repacked file in the S3 bucket is verified.
* If the file does not exist, the file is downloaded, repacked using the h5repack tool, and the repacked file is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

**Step 3: Update Metadata (`update_metadata.py`)**
After each file is processed, the metadata is updated to reflect the change in filename of the repacked file.

**Step 4: Clean up**
Once all the files in the job queue have been processed, the process will terminate.

Please note that the environment variables such as `UUID` are configured automatically when the job is created. The credentials for the S3 bucket are also handled automatically via Kubernetes secrets. These details allow the process to run smoothly without manual intervention or the need for in-depth understanding from the user.
